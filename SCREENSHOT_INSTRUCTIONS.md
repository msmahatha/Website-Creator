# 📸 How to Add Your Application Screenshots

## The Issue
The screenshots from your application attachments need to be manually saved as actual image files. Currently, we have placeholder text files instead of real images.

## 🎯 Quick Fix Steps

### 1. Save Your Screenshots
From the images you showed me, save these as PNG files:

1. **main-interface.png** - The main dark theme interface with URL input
2. **educational-disclaimer.png** - The disclaimer modal popup
3. **about-page.png** - The about page with mission and tech stack
4. **user-guide.png** - The user guide with 3-step process
5. **website-analysis.png** - The GitHub analysis results page
6. **html-code-view.png** - The HTML code extraction view
7. **ai-features.png** - The AI reconstruction features page

### 2. Save Location
Save all images to: `/Users/madhusudanmahatha/website-inspector/assets/images/`

### 3. Update README
After saving the real images, update the README.md by replacing the placeholder URLs:

**Change this:**
```markdown
![Main Interface](https://via.placeholder.com/800x500/2d3748/ffffff?text=Website+Inspector+Pro+Main+Interface)
```

**To this:**
```markdown
![Main Interface](./assets/images/main-interface.png)
```

Do this for all 7 images.

### 4. Commit and Push
```bash
git add assets/images/*.png
git add README.md
git commit -m "Add actual application screenshots"
git push origin main
```

## 🚀 Alternative: Use Current Placeholders
If you prefer to keep the current professional placeholder images for now, they already look good and convey the application's purpose. You can add real screenshots later.

## 📝 Current Status
✅ README structure is ready
✅ Descriptions are comprehensive  
✅ Placeholder images are professional
⏳ Real screenshots need manual addition

The README currently shows professional placeholder images that maintain the visual appeal while you prepare the actual screenshots.
