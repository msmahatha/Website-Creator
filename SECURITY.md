## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do Not Create Public Issues

Please **do not** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities. This helps protect users until a fix is available.

Include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fixes (if any)

### 3. Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Confirmation**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity
  - Critical: 1-3 days
  - High: 1-2 weeks
  - Medium: 2-4 weeks
  - Low: Next release cycle

### 4. Disclosure Process

1. We acknowledge receipt of your report
2. We confirm the vulnerability and determine severity
3. We develop and test a fix
4. We prepare a security advisory
5. We release the fix and advisory simultaneously
6. We credit you in the advisory (if desired)

## Security Best Practices
